    <section>
      <p>
        Computer Science student at Gdańsk University of Technology with strong
        foundations in algorithms, systems programming, and Linux environments.
        Experienced in Go, C/C++, and C# as well as familiar with Java, Python,
        Ruby, Rust, and TypeScript, through academic and personal projects,
        including self-hosted infrastructure and low-level development.
      </p>

      <h2>AVAILABILITY & COMMITMENT</h2>
      <p>
        I am looking for a long-term professional relationship rather than a
        short-term placement. My intended availability is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Current Semester:</b> Part-time internship (approx. 20h/week).
        </li>
        <li><b>Summer 2026:</b> Transition to full-time engineering.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Academic Year 2026/27:</b> Return to part-time until graduation.
        </li>
        <li><b>Post-Graduation:</b> Transition to permanent full-time role.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>SELECTED PROJECTS</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>B+ Tree Implementation <span>Rust</span></h3>
        <p>
          A disk-friendly B+ tree implementation focusing on memory-efficient
          data structures and safety.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
          Python-to-Ruby Transpiler
          <span>Flex / Bison / C++ / Make</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A compiler-front-end project focused on lexer/parser design. Solved
          complex build-orchestration challenges involving circular dependencies
          by mastering advanced Makefile configurations. This project allowed me
          to familiarize myself with lexer and parser design, engineer a lexing
          solution for significant indentation in Python, while effectively
          modeling real-world objects through class design.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>External Sorting Implementation <span>C++</span></h3>
        <p>
          High-performance implementation for sorting datasets exceeding RAM
          capacity. Utilized min-heaps and optimized disk I/O buffers to manage
          large-scale data processing efficiently.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Order Tracker for Cake Shop <span>Go / SQLite / HTMX</span></h3>
        <p>
          A production-ready logistics system for a local business. Features
          transactional integrity, secure session-based auth, and a dynamic UI
          using HTMX. The entire stack is compiled into a single binary using
          Go's embed system for zero-dependency deployment.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
          Self-Hosted Infrastructure
          <span>Debian / Docker / NixOS</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Management of a production environment for media, backups, and small
          business order-tracking. Running in Docker, secured behind an overlay
          VPN, and exposed via Cloudflare tunnels when required.

      <h2>DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in <b>Deep Ownership</b>. Beyond writing code, I strive to
        understand the entire delivery chain—from database commit logs and
        memory management to final binary deployment. I am guided by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Intentional Tooling:</b> I choose stacks based on problem-solving
          efficiency rather than industry trends. This pragmatic approach
          ensures the right tool is used for the specific performance
          requirements of the task.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Minimalism:</b> I prioritize low dependency counts to reduce attack
          surfaces, minimize maintenance debt, and ensure lightning-fast
          execution—whether in a systems binary or a browser-based UI.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Transparency:</b> I value understanding the abstractions I use. My
          experience with systems-level languages (C, Go, Rust) provides me with
          a unique perspective on optimizing high-level applications and
          debugging complex performance bottlenecks.
        </li>
      </ul>
