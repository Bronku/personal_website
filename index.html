      <p>
        Computer Science student at Gdańsk University of Technology with strong
        foundations in algorithms, systems programming, and Linux environments.
        Experienced in Go, C/C++, and C# as well as familiar with Java, Python,
        Ruby, Rust, and TypeScript, through academic and personal projects,
        including self-hosted infrastructure and low-level development.

      <h2>SELECTED PROJECTS</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>B+ Tree Implementation <span>Rust</span></h3>
        <p>
          A B+ tree implementation focusing on memory-efficient data structures
          and safety.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Python-to-Ruby Transpiler
          <span>Flex / Bison / C++ / Make</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A simplified transpiler for converting Python scripts to Ruby. This
          project allowed me to familiarize myself with lexer and parser design,
          while effectively modeling real-world objects through class design. It
          also required an in-depth study of Makefiles to automate a complex
          build process involving circular dependencies between various files.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>External Sorting Implementation <span>C++</span></h3>
        <p>
          An implementation for sorting files too large to fit in primary
          memory. This project required efficient disk-write management and the
          utilization of various data structures, such as a min-heap.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Order Tracker for Cake Shop <span>Go / SQLite</span></h3>
        <p>
          A full-stack solution for local business logistics. Focused on a fast,
          dependency-light frontend. Fully managed and deployed independently.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
          Self-Hosted Infrastructure
          <span>Debian / Docker / NixOS</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Management of a production environment for media, backups, and small
          business order-tracking. Running in Docker, secured behind an overlay
          VPN, and exposed via Cloudflare tunnels when required.

      <h2>TECHNICAL PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <p>
        I value <b>simplicity, ownership, and efficiency</b>. My preference for
        languages like C and Go stems from a desire to understand the hardware
        beneath the code. I apply this logic to my homelab, where I prioritize
        self-hosting over third-party dependencies. This is why I prefer ssh to
        my home server over GitHub and strive to minimize dependencies in my own
        code.
